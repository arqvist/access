# Arqvist Access

## The ACL controller to manage your storages

The Arqvist Access is the authorization gateway from your applications to your storages.

You can register applications, storages, define access points for them and set a fine grained permission level for each.

Register **locations** with an actual path to your storage and set access to it.

**Accesses** are abstract entry points to your locations, so if a location is moved you won't have to change any code in you application.

You can also set **permissions** to describe exactly what each application can do in a certain access.

Using the **multi-tenant** mode you can provide a centralized ACL for all your company.

If you don't want to concern with installations you can use our **Arqvist Access as a Service**.

>NOTE:
>This application is an API. You must provide an admin to deal with it. We recommend the Arqvist Admin.

All install instructions are described in documentation.
